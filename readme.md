# Eugenio Monesma - Rope-making Ontology

A domain-specific Ontology originating from the documentary by Eugenio Monesma's series capturing traditional manufacturing practices in rural communities in europe. 
This Ontology is a work in progress, and built from the transcript of the YouTube video, [The ropers. Braiding of natural ropes with curious manual rigs that have now disappeared](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygSijsOEano)
